#  Incident 8 – SQL Injection Detected (SOC127)

**Platform:** LetsDefend.io  
**Incident ID:** 235  
**Rule Name:** SOC127 – SQL Injection Detected  
**Severity:** High  
**Type:** Web Attack  
**Status:** Closed – True Positive  

---

## 1. Incident Overview

A **SOC127 alert** was triggered after LetsDefend detected a **SQL Injection (SQLi) attack** targeting an internal web application hosted on **WebServer1000**.  
The malicious request contained **classic UNION-based SQL injection**, **cross-site scripting (XSS)**, and **command execution (`xp_cmdshell`)** payloads, indicating an advanced and deliberate exploitation attempt.

Analysis confirmed that the payload was successfully processed by the backend application, making this incident a **confirmed compromise attempt** requiring escalation.

## 3. Payload & Exploitation Analysis

### Observed Malicious Request (URL Encoded)

The request contained a heavily obfuscated payload attempting:
- Authentication bypass
- Database enumeration
- Stored XSS injection
- OS command execution via database

### Decoded Payload
```http
GET /?douj=3034 AND 1=1 UNION ALL SELECT 1,NULL,
'<script>alert("XSS")</script>',table_name
FROM information_schema.tables
WHERE 2>1--/**/;
EXEC xp_cmdshell('cat ../../../../etc/passwd')
```

### Key Observations
- UNION-based SQL Injection
- Stored XSS payload embedded
- `xp_cmdshell` execution attempt
- Linux file system access (`/etc/passwd`)
- Strong indicator of successful SQLi execution

## 8. MITRE ATT&CK Mapping

| Tactic | Technique |
|------|-----------|
| Initial Access | T1190 – Exploit Public-Facing Application |
| Execution | T1059 – Command and Scripting Interpreter |
| Credential Access | T1555 – Credentials from Web Applications |
| Defense Evasion | T1027 – Obfuscated Files or Information |

---

## 9. Response & Actions Taken

- Incident validated as **True Positive**
- Attack confirmed as successful
- Escalated to **Tier 2**
- WebServer1000 recommended for isolation
- Artifacts added for correlation
- WAF tuning and URL blocklisting recommended

---

## 10. Recommended Actions

### Containment
- Block the attacker IP (**118.194.247.28**) at firewall and WAF.
- Temporarily isolate **WebServer1000** if active exploitation is ongoing.
- Disable vulnerable application endpoints if required.

---

### Threat Hunting
- Review web server and WAF logs for additional SQLi payloads.
- Search for database queries involving `UNION`, `information_schema`, or `xp_cmdshell`.
- Identify any abnormal outbound connections from the web server.

---

### Eradication
- Disable dangerous database features such as `xp_cmdshell`.
- Rotate database credentials used by the web application.
- Remove any web shells or unauthorized files if found.

---

### Mitigation & Prevention
- Implement parameterized queries / prepared statements in application code.
- Enforce least-privilege permissions for database service accounts.
- Enable and tune WAF rules for SQLi and XSS detection.
- Apply secure input validation and output encoding.

## 11. Final Analyst Verdict

- **True Positive**
- Successful SQL Injection attempt
- Immediate remediation required
- SOC controls detected but did not prevent execution

## 12. Remediation Recommendations

- Enable and tune **WAF SQLi/XSS rules**
- Block malicious source IPs
- Disable risky database functions (`xp_cmdshell`)
- Apply least-privilege DB permissions
- Patch and harden the web application
- Conduct full forensic review of WebServer1000

## 13. Analyst Notes

This incident demonstrates how **poor input validation and exposed database functions** can lead to full application compromise.  
Continuous monitoring, WAF enforcement, and secure coding practices are essential to prevent similar SQL Injection attacks.
