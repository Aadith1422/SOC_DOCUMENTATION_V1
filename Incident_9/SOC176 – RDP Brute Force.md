## 2. Alert Metadata

- **Event ID:** 234  
- **Event Time:** Mar 07, 2024 – 11:44 AM  
- **Date Closed:** Dec 24, 2025 – 12:15 PM  
- **Rule Level:** Security Analyst  
- **Source IP:** 218.92.0.56  
- **Destination IP:** 172.16.17.148  
- **Hostname:** Matthew  
- **Protocol:** RDP (TCP/3389)  
- **Firewall Action:** Allowed

## 8. Process Execution Analysis (Post-Compromise Validation)

Endpoint process monitoring confirmed interactive session establishment.

- **Process:** winlogon.exe  
- **Parent:** smss.exe  
- **Execution Time:** Mar 07, 2024 – 11:44:54  
- **User Context:** NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM  

This validates a real RDP session.
