## 12. Recommended Actions

### Containment
- Isolate the affected endpoint (**Austin**).
- Block the malicious IP (**84.38.130.118**) and related URLs.
- Quarantine and remove the malicious RTF email from all mailboxes.

---

### Threat Hunting
- Search for similar RTF attachments in email logs.
- Hunt for suspicious process chains such as:
  - `OUTLOOK.EXE → cmd.exe → regsvr32.exe`
- Monitor for LOLBin abuse (`regsvr32.exe`, `mshta.exe`, `rundll32.exe`).

---

### Eradication
- Remove any malicious artifacts from the endpoint.
- Reset affected user credentials.
- Reimage the system if payload execution or persistence is confirmed.

---
